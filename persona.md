## Biography
Klaudia spent several years as a freelance translator and later worked in an LSP, focusing on software localization. Her exposure to messy source content and inconsistent terminology sparked her interest in the upstream side of the process — writing. She recently transitioned into a technical writing role and is currently exploring tools like MadCap Flare and Lingo to better support her company’s international growth. Her background in localization gives her a unique edge in creating globally ready content from the ground up.
